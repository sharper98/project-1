# Simple Spotify Album Searcher
I'm extremely passionate about music, so my initial idea for this project was to integrate Spotify's API and create an app that could be used as a place to search fore and review music. I soon realized that I bit off more than I could chew and ended up making a mess of code. I ended up scrapping the original plan and decided to start with something smaller that would just be basically a search engine for Spotify albums. From there I plan on continue working on this app until it becomes my own Letterboxd but for music.
